# Issue Tracker

## Problem Statement
Create a Node.js + EJS application to track issues/bugs for a project. This project draws inspiration from GitHub issue tracker and similar applications.

## Features
1. **Build a neat UI**
2. **Home Page**
   - Show a list of projects.
   - Provide a button to create a new Project. (On creating a new project, it should appear in the list.)

3. **Create Project Page**
   - Accept the following fields to create a project:
     - Name
     - Description
     - Author

4. **Project Detail Page**
   - When a user clicks on a project (in the home page), redirect the user to this page which will show bugs related to this project.
   - User should be able to perform the following actions on this page:
     - Filter by multiple labels (i.e., filter by 2 or more labels at the same time).
     - Filter by author.
     - Search by title and description.
     - A button to create an issue.

5. **Create Issue Page**
   - User should be able to create an issue for a project.
   - Accept the following fields:
     - Title
     - Description
     - Labels (multiple labels can be added to a project. If a project has a label already, show it (in dropdown) as the user types the label in).
     - Author

## Instructions
1. You are allowed to style the app any way you like.
2. Once you have finished with the test, make a video recording of your computer screen (via phone or a software like OBS/screencastify etc.) and give a walkthrough of your product (showcase project functionalities). The video can be UP TO 5 mins long.
3. Upload frontend and backend code on GitHub, and share the URLs.
